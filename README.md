# vim
Repo containing my vim stuff. At this point, it's just a vimrc. If I ever get around to converting my plugins to submodules, those will be included here too.

Most of the stuff in here are plugins written by others for various languages.

However, java-tide is my own plugin that I wrote to let me do some smarter, Java-specific things with tags. This allows me to get the critical stuff I want out of an IDE (scope aware auto-complete and smarter imports basically) without having to use a full IDE with all the attendant baggage.
