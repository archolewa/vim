# vim
Repo containing my vim stuff. 

Most of the stuff in here are plugins written by others for various languages.

However, java-tide is my own plugin that I wrote to let me do some smarter, Java-specific things with tags. This allows me to get the critical stuff I want out of an IDE (scope aware auto-complete and smarter imports basically) without having to use a full IDE with all the attendant baggage.
